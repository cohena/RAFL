RAFL is a Ruby Audio File Library, written by Aaron Cohen (c) 2009. Distributed under the LGPL license.

To get a sense of its capabilities, run RAFLcopter.rb. Only WAV files are currently supported (any number of channels, including surround). BWAV extensions are likely in the future.

Current limitations are:

A serious lack of documentation
Only 16 bit audio is supported
Performance needs optimization. Run on Ruby 1.9 for best results.
